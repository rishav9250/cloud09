What are the Cloud Storage Levels?


Cloud storage device mechanisms provide common levels of data storage, such as:

Files – These are collections of data that are grouped into files that are located in folders.
Blocks – A block is the smallest unit of data that is individually accessible. It is the lowest level of storage and the closest to the hardware.
Datasets – Data sets organized into a table-based, delimited, or record format.
Objects – Data and the associated metadata with it are organized as web-based resources.
Each of the above data storage levels is associated with a certain type of technical interface. This interface corresponds to a particular type of cloud storage device and the cloud storage service used to expose its API.
